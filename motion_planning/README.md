# Motion Planning

This module provides basic questions to explain and test concepts related to motion planning.

## Questions

Below are the questions. See the following section for the submission instructions.

### A* Algorithm
A* is a popular path planning algorithm. You can find a GIF of it in action [here](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics#a-algorithm) and Python code for it [here](https://github.com/AtsushiSakai/PythonRobotics/blob/master/PathPlanning/AStar/a_star.py).

1. Use any resources to learn about A*. Then, summarize, in your own words, what it is and how it works in 2-3 sentences. You may comment on things like its optimality, completeness, efficiency, pros and cons, or performance relative to other algorithms.
2. Run the A* algorithm with different goal locations and grid sizes. Generate some figures (3-6 figures) and describe any differences you observe (just a few of sentences). You do NOT have to write the algorithm's code yourself. You can use any implementation. If the code is available online, simply include a link to it in your submission. Otherwise, please include the code in your submission.

## Submission
Create a folder called `motion_planning` and include the following files:
- Create a word document titled `solution` with your answers to questions 1 and 2 (including the figures).
- If you wrote code, include it as well.
